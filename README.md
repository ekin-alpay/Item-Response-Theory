# Item-Response-Theory
Repository for my small IRT projects including dichotomous and polytomous items; item, person and model fit; and scoring. While there are other packages on `R` available specifically for IRT models, my projects here leverage on `mirt` for analysis and `lattice`for plots and `latticeExtra` for plot merging.  

The `.rmd` files here are my homeworks and exams submitted for EPSY586-IRT course at UIUC Spring 2024. The data here are provided by the course instructor.
